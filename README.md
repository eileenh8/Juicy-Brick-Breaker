# Juicy Brick Breako

October 11, 2023

Description

Adding "juicy" elements to a simple brick-breaker game.

## To play

Move the paddle using the mouse. Release the ball (and trigger fever mode) using the left mouse button. Assist the ball in breaking all the bricks before you run out of time.

## Implementation

Created using [Godot 4.1.1](https://godotengine.org/download)

Which features you included:

Changed colors/theme.

Changed sprites.

Red squares to indicate the number of lives. 

The wall changes color every time the ball hits it.

Confetti particles every time the ball hits the paddle.

Bubble particles every time the ball hits bricks.

Paddle highlights when hit.

The ball gets bigger when it hits something.

Bricks falling in place before the game.

Bricks fade and rotate when hit.

The screen shakes when you die.

Comet trail on the ball.

Fire shader added in the fever bar.

Music and sound effects.

I created the Wall and Die sounds.
